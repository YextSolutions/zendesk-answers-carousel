# Zendesk Frontend Carousel
### Use the Yext Answers API to power a stream of content on your help site
There are a variety of creative ways to leverage the structured information in a knowledge graph beyond serving a traditional Answers Experience. Yext’s variety of [consumer-grade APIs](https://hitchhikers.yext.com/docs/) makes it easy for developers to use data (entities, results, analytics) from their knowledge graph to power a variety of creative applications. 

One such way in the support space, is to call the [Universal Search Endpoint](https://hitchhikers.yext.com/docs/liveapis/answersapi/universalsearch/#operation/query) and map the returned fields to a rotating carousel of content cards displayed on your help site. This is just one example of an incredibly flexible framework (just change your query input!) that’s equally as lightweight to implement.

Zendesk admins should reference this GitHub repo to see what changes are needed to implement an example of this carousel and achieve the below result. Simply copy and paste the provided code into the specified portal files, making sure to update the ‘REPLACE_ME…’ variables with your Yext-specific Answers Experience details.
